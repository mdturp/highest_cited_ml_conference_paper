# Highest cited machine learning conference paper

This is a small little website that ranks machine learning papers
from the ICML, Neurips & ICLR conferences based on their citation
count. The citation counts are continuously updated.
Citation counts are taken from Semantic Scholar.

## Issues

Since all papers have been parsed and queried using scripts, it can happen that some links or citation counts are not correct or that a paper
that has been published at one of the venues is not part of the list. If you encounter such a problem, please open an issue, and let's update the list together.
